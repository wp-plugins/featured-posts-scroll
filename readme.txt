== Installation ==

= Installation =

1. Use the built-in WordPress plugin installer.
   OR
   Download the zip file and extract the contents.
   Upload the 'featured-posts-scroll' folder to your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/).
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress 'Plugins' menu.
3. Recommendation: Refer to "How to Use" and "FAQ" for useful info.

= How to Use =

To use this plugin to display the most recent posts in any category and with any tag:

1. Copy and paste the code below to your desired template location:
<code><?php if (function_exists('fps_show')) { echo fps_show(NULL); } ?></code>

If you would like to customize what posts are displayed:

1. Copy and paste the code below to your desired template location:
<code><?php if (function_exists('fps_show')) {
            $args = array(
                'cat'     => '',/* comma separated list of category ids to include (put '-' in front of ids to exclude) */
                'tag'     => '' /* comma separated list tag slugs to include */);
            echo fps_show($args);
        }?></code>
2. Modify the '$args' array to filter out only the posts that you would like displayed. Delete any entries in the array you don't want to use (be careful with the commas. See here(http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Query#Parameters) for more details on all valid query parameters. Contact me if you have any questions about getting just the posts that you want.
3. Recommendation: Create a new 'featured' tag and put it on the posts that you want to displayed and add that category's slug to the array in the code above.

If you would like to display the featured posts scroll inside of a post:

* Insert the following shortcode in your post:
<code>[fps]</code>
* Arguments can also be used with the shortcode to specify posts to display:
<code>[fps cat="-3" tag="featured"]</code>



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= FAQ =

= Where do the images displayed come from? =
Images are based on the "Featured Image" selected on the Edit Post screen. If the option is not displayed, click Screen Options in the top right of the Edit Post screen and check the "Featured Image" checkbox.

= I changed the size of the post scroll, but my images didn't change size. What do I need to do? =
Any new image added to your site should have a thumbnail created in the correct new size. However, the old thumbnails will need to be regenerated. This can be done for all images on your site with the excellent ["Regenerate Thumbnails" plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).

= What guidelines should I use when creating custom arrow images? =
The easiest way to figure this out is just to look at the images included with the plugin (wp-content/plugins/featured-posts-scroll/images), and format your images in the same basic manner. For the default arrow position (sides of the image), the arrow image should be 46x100. For the alternate arrow position at the bottom of the scroll, the arrow image should be 48x48. 

In either case, the image should be split into four evenly sized quadrants. The top row is left/right arrows as they normally appear and the bottom row are the arrows as they appear when hovered over. The left column should be arrows pointing left, and the right column should be arrows pointing right.
